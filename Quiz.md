\f0\fs32 \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 Property
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0class?\
In console.rb.\
Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 Property
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0object into the database?\
require(\'91pg\'92) in properties.rb\
Q3. In\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 console.rb
\f0\fs32 \cb3 , which lines modify the database?\
4, 13, 22, 31, 33\
Q4. Why do we not define the id of a\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 Property
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0object at the point we instantiate it (\'91new it up\'92)?\
Because the id is assigned automatically when the object is passed to the table.\
Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 Property
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0object?\
Line 32 in properties.rb. id is generated by the database, we then have the table return id to us and then we read and store it in @id.\
Q6. Why do we put a guard (an\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 if
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0clause) on the\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 @id
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0attribute in the constructor?\
Because since the id property is not defined in the constructor, we want to make sure we run the to_i method only when we get something back from our database when we Create a record.\
Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?\
Because some actions you want to run on a specific instance of a class (delete a single instance for example), sometimes you want to run it on the whole class (find_by_address, you want to search all instances of a class)\
Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 db.exec_prepared()
\f0\fs32 \cb3 ? In the\'a0
\f1\fs27\fsmilli13600 \cb4 save
\f0\fs32 \cb3 \'a0method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?\
It\'92s an array of hashes. We access the id in save method by accessing the first element of the array (it will only have one in this case), and then the id key in the hash.\
Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?\
To avoid unwanted operations or results, such as sql injection.}
